# 19-Cryptocurrencies
# Project Overview

The purpose of this project is to create a report that includes what cryptocurrencies are on the trading market and how they could be grouped to create a classification system for new investments.

## Methods

Prepare given dataset data. Analyze  data using unsupervised machine learning techniques and visualize results.

### Resourses

The dataset  from CryptoCompare - [crypto_data.csv](https://github.com/xenia-e/18-Cryptocurrencies/blob/main/Resources/crypto_data.csv)

## Deliverables
This project consists of four technical analysis deliverables included in [jupyter notebook file](https://github.com/xenia-e/18-Cryptocurrencies/blob/main/crypto_clustering.ipynb):

__*Deliverable 1:*__ Preprocessing the Data for PCA

__*Deliverable 2:*__ Reducing Data Dimensions Using PCA

__*Deliverable 3:*__ Clustering Cryptocurrencies Using 
K-means

__*Deliverable 4:*__ Visualizing Cryptocurrencies Results
